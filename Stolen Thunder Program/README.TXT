Project: Stolen thunder
Authors: Jenny

This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. The game takes place
in the Mount Olympus, home to the Greek Gods and Goddesses. The character you
will be playing is a demi-god, an outcasted child of Zeus, born out of wedlock
from one of the many affairs he had with a mortal. Because of your mortal 
mother, you are looked down upon by the other Gods and Goddesses, as well as 
their full-blooded demigod children so you're treated often as a servant. One
day, Zeus' thunderbolt goes missing and you are tasked with the responsibility
to find it in order to prove your worthy of having the status of a demigod.
The player can win the game by finding out who has stolen Zeus' thunderbolt
by exploring the different chambers and speaking to each God/Goddess and
successfully retrieve the thunderbold back to Zeus.
